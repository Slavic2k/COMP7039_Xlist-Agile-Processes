# COMP7039_Xlist-Agile-Processes
IT.3 ITM3
The purpose of this project is to pull data from the web, develop a visualisation to understand the data and use an LLM to extract knowledge. We achieved the first two goals over the course of two sprints. The first sprint was dedicated to finding data and processing it for use. The second sprint revolved around creating a website to visualise the dataset. To create the data, we pulled eight CSVs from the web that contained the prices of various commodities each month for a period of ten years. The commodities chosen were a mix of precious and industrial metals. These CSVs were saved in Google Sheets to be cleaned up for use in sprint two. To visualise the data in sprint two, a website was created using HTML, JavaScript, CSS and the library Chart.js. The development of the website was kept up to date with a github repository. The website consists of nine pages, including a home page and eight pages dedicated to various metals with interactive charts. At the time of concluding sprint two, we have a fully functional website that allows users to easily and interactively visualise the dataset.
