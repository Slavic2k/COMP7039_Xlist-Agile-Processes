COMP7039 – Agile Processes: 
Project: Commodity Price Visualisation Through The Agile Process


This project was developed as part of the IT.3 / ITM3 assessment for COMP7039.
The goal was to:

Research Data Sets and use it to develop an product

Develop visualisations to explore and understand the data

Use an LLM to extract knowledge from the dataset

Project Summary (IT.3 / ITM3)

The purpose of this project is to retrieve real-world commodity data, visualise it to support insight generation, and integrate an LLM for knowledge extraction.

Home page

8 individual metal pages (e.g., Gold, Silver, Aluminium, etc.)
Each metal page features an graphchart using the dataset we researched.

Metal Pages
Along with this there also a metal facts section
Finally using an LLM we provide our users with possible trends and anomalies

Root Redirect to /src

GitHub Pages requires an index.html in the root of the repository.
Because all website files are inside /src, a lightweight redirect is used:

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=src/index.html">


This allows:

https://slavic2k.github.io/COMP7039_Xlist-Agile-Processes/


to load the real site in /src.

*Side Note*
If you attempt to run this code in an offline enviorment then the graph charts will not function. 
If using VSCode install the extension 'live server' to see the graph charts run
